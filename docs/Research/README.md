# Research resources

This folder collects reference material that informed BBCF Improvement Mod's memory and input research. The `Tadatys-BBCF-Ghidra/` subfolder contains the Ghidra exports and helper scripts shared publicly by **tadatys** in the [BBCF-Ghidra repository](https://github.com/Tadatys/BBCF-Ghidra). Those files remain in their original form so contributors can trace offsets back to the upstream research and credit the author directly.

If you add more third-party research artifacts in the future, group them in clearly labeled subfolders with links to their sources so the provenance stays obvious.
